Specification of DAQ-HDF format
===============================

This Python package contains the parts of the DAQ-HDF specication that are independent of
the actual IO implementation, i.e. the hierarchy, names of groups, attributes and dtypes, as
well as some helper functions (e.g. for extraction of CONT block id from its name).
